How does it work?
Introduction
React-three-fiber is a React renderer for three.js.




Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can participate in React's ecosystem.


npm
 
install
 three @types/three @react-three/fiber



Does it have limitations?


None. Everything that works in Threejs will work here without exception.


Is it slower than plain Threejs?


No. There is no overhead. Components render outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to Reacts scheduling abilities.


Can it keep up with frequent feature updates to Threejs?


Yes. It merely expresses Threejs in JSX, 
<mesh />
 dynamically turns into 
new THREE.Mesh()
. If a new Threejs version adds, removes or changes features, it will be available to you instantly without depending on updates to this library.


What does it look like?


Let's make a re-usable component that has its own state, reacts to user-input and participates in the
render-loop. (

First steps


You need to be versed in both React and Threejs before rushing into this. If you are unsure about React consult the official 
React docs
, especially 
the section about hooks
. As for Threejs, make sure you at least glance over the following links:




Make sure you have a 
basic grasp of Threejs
. Keep that site open.


When you know what a scene is, a camera, mesh, geometry, material, fork the 
demo above
.


Look up
 the JSX elements that you see (mesh, ambientLight, etc), 
all
 threejs exports are native to three-fiber.


Try changing some values, scroll through our 
API
 to see what the various settings and hooks do.

Changes and new features with v8 and react 18
Work on version 8 has begun 3 Sep 2021 and is perhaps the biggest update to Fiber yet. We've tried our best to keep breaking-changes to a minimum, they mostly affect rarely used api's like 
attach
. This release brings a ton of performance related fixes, but also includes some new and ground breaking features.


We would like to express our gratitude to the community for their continued support, as well as to all our contributors. üéâ


React Native support


With React 18 and Expo 43, you can now ship threejs goodness across web and native. These apps are not confined to a web-view, they are truly native OpenGLES.


Now expo-gl, which does the hard lifting, has existed for a while, but we've addressed some of the common concerns related to interop and making the three eco system readily work in the native space. For instance, you handle assets the same exact way you'd treat them in a web app.


See 
installation
 to get started with managed Expo or bare React Native apps.

This is complete with support for Pressability events and native threejs loaders. See

Zustand and suspend-react


Fiber uses 
zustand
 to manage state. It's a simple, powerful, and performant state management library for React. And 
suspend-react
 to manage async ops and suspense (useLoader for instance). You can use these in your projects as well as they are to get closer interop with Fiber.


New pixel ratio default


The default DPR has changed from 
1
 to 
[1, 2]
, which will clamp between 1 and 2, but prefer 2, depending on the screen's native pixel ratio.


This was the most common setting in the wild, so it was brought in as a better default.


-
 <Canvas dpr={[1, 2]} />

+
 <Canvas />



Color management


Color management is now being handled by Three R139. Therefore we set 
THREE.ColorManagement.enabled
 to 
true
 and cede to touch colors and textures since everything will now be converted from sRGB to linear color space by Three itself.


You can manipulate this yourself with the 
legacy
 prop:


// sets THREE.ColorManagement.enabled = false


<
Canvas
 
legacy
=
{
true
}
>




While you can of course use Fiber with any Three version you like we recommend updating to R139.


Check out 
https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Color-management
 for information.


Automatic concurrency


Concurrency is now part of React 18, which automatically switches between blocking (default) and concurrent (async).


-
 <Canvas mode="concurrent" />

+
 <Canvas />



React 18 introduces the 
startTransition
 and 
useTransition
 APIs to defer and schedule expensive operations and state updates. Use these to de-prioritize expensive operations.


import
 
{
 startTransition 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
Points
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'




const
 
[
radius
,
 setRadius
]
 
=
 
useState
(
1
)


const
 positions 
=
 
calculatePositions
(
radius
)


const
 colors 
=
 
calculateColors
(
radius
)


const
 sizes 
=
 
calculateSizes
(
radius
)




<
Points


  
positions
=
{
positions
}


  
colors
=
{
colors
}


  
sizes
=
{
sizes
}


  
onPointerOut
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
startTransition
(
(
)
 
=>
 
setRadius
(
prev
 
=>
 prev 
+
 
1
)
)
}


>


  
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
vertexColors
 
/>


</
Points
>




Examples


Please be careful, this is an extreme stress test. It creates so much load that without React the browser will freeze or crash.




Conditional rendering with frameloop


frameloop
 can now be toggled to render conditionally. This is useful to toggle on user interaction or while in frame.


const
 
[
frameloop
,
 setFrameloop
]
 
=
 
useState
(
'never'
)




<
Canvas


  
frameloop
=
{
frameloop
}


  
onClick
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
setFrameloop
(
'always'
)
}


/>




Another usecase would be using intersection observers to stop the canvas when it's out of view.


const
 canvasRef 
=
 
useRef
(
)


const
 
[
frameloop
,
 setFrameloop
]
 
=
 
useState
(
'never'
)




useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 observer 
=
 
new
 
IntersectionObserver
(
(
[
{
 isIntersecting 
}
]
)
 
=>
 
{


    
setFrameloop
(
isIntersecting 
?
 
'always'
 
:
 
'never'
)


  
}
,
 
{
}
)




  observer
.
observe
(
canvasRef
.
current
)


  
return
 
(
)
 
=>
 observer
.
disconnect
(
)


}
,
 
[
]
)




<
Canvas
 
ref
=
{
canvasRef
}
 
frameloop
=
{
frameloop
}
 
/>




Expanded gl prop


The 
gl
 prop can now accept both constructor args and renderer properties like the 
camera
 prop.


<
Canvas
 
gl
=
{
{
 
alpha
:
 
false
,
 
physicallyCorrectLights
:
 
true
 
}
}
 
/>




It can also accept a synchronous callback to manually create a renderer. This allows you to use any custom renderer you want.


<
Canvas
 
gl
=
{
(
canvas
)
 
=>
 
new
 
Renderer
(
{
 canvas 
}
)
}
 
/>




Improved WebXR handling


Automatic WebXR switching


The 
vr
 prop was removed in favor of automatic WebXR switching. Whenever a session is requested, XR features are enabled, and the renderer will render at the native refresh rate. The inverse is true when exiting a session.




frameloop
 will not be respected while in a session.




-
 <Canvas vr />

+
 <Canvas />



Extended useFrame


In addition to the automatic rendering, useFrame will expose the current 
XRFrame
 obtained via 
XRSession#requestAnimationFrame
.


useFrame
(
(
state
:
 RootState
,
 delta
:
 
number
,
 frame
?
:
 
THREE
.
XRFrame
)
 
=>
 
{
 
...
 
}
)




This removes the need for custom rendering loops when using WebXR pose data and abstractions like 
useXRFrame
 of 
@react-three/xr
.


Manual camera manipulation


By default Fiber is responsive and will set up cameras properly on resize (aspect ratio etc).


Cameras can be controlled manually by setting 
manual
 to true in 
camera
. This will opt out of projection matrix recalculation when the drawing area resizes.


<
Canvas
 
camera
=
{
{
 
manual
:
 
true
 
}
}
>




This is also supported by all cameras that you create, be it a THREE.PerspectiveCamera or drei/cameras, put 
manual
 on it and Fiber will not touch it.


import
 
{
 
PerspectiveCamera
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'


<
Canvas
>


  
<
PerspectiveCamera
 
makeDefault
 
manual
 
/>


</
Canvas
>




Unified attach API


Previously, attach had multiple signatures:




attach="name"


attachObject={["name", "attribute"]}


attachArray="name"


attachFns={["add", "remove"]}


attachFns={[(self, parent) => parent.add(self), (self, parent) => parent.remove(self)]}




This is now a single, unified signature with support for piercing and named attach functions or custom handlers.


// Attach foo to parent.a


<
foo
 
attach
=
"
a
"
 
/>




// Attach foo to parent.a.b and a.b.c (nested object attach)


<
foo
 
attach
=
"
a-b
"
 
/>


<
foo
 
attach
=
"
a-b-c
"
 
/>




// Attach foo to parent.a[0] and [1] (array attach is just object attach)


<
foo
 
attach
=
"
a-0
"
 
/>


<
foo
 
attach
=
"
a-1
"
 
/>




// Attach foo to parent via explicit add/remove functions


<
foo attach
=
{
(
parent
,
 self
)
 
=>
 
{


  parent
.
add
(
self
)


  
return
 
(
)
 
=>
 parent
.
remove
(
self
)


}
 
/
>




// The same as a one liner


<
foo
 
attach
=
{
(
parent
,
 self
)
 
=>
 
(
parent
.
add
(
self
)
,
 
(
)
 
=>
 parent
.
remove
(
self
)
)
}
 
/>




Real-world use-cases:


Attaching to nested objects:


-
 <directionalLight

-
   castShadow

-
   position={[2.5, 8, 5]}

-
   shadow-mapSize={[1024, 1024]}

-
   shadow-camera-far={50}

-
   shadow-camera-left={-10}

-
   shadow-camera-right={10}

-
   shadow-camera-top={10}

-
   shadow-camera-bottom={-10}

-
 />

+
 <directionalLight castShadow position={[2.5, 8, 5]} shadow-mapSize={[1024, 1024]}>

+
   <orthographicCamera attach="shadow-camera" args={[-10, 10, 10, -10]} />

+
 </directionalLight>



<
bufferGeometry>

-
   <bufferAttribute attachObject={['attributes', 'position']} count={count} array={vertices} itemSize={3} />

+
   <bufferAttribute attach="attributes-position" count={count} array={vertices} itemSize={3} />

<
/bufferGeometry>



Arrays must be explcit now:


<
mesh>

-
  {colors.map((color, index) => <meshBasicMaterial key={index} attachArray="material" color={color} />)}

+
  {colors.map((color, index) => <meshBasicMaterial key={index} attach={`material-${index}`} color={color} />)}

<
/mesh>



Spread Canvas props


The 
<Canvas />
 can now accept non-render props to spread as native props: styles, classes, events, a11y, ...


-
 <div aria-describedby={...}>

-
  <Canvas />

-
 </div>

+
 <Canvas aria-describedby={...} />



New createRoot API


render
 is depreciated in v8 for the new 
createRoot
 signature.


import {

-
 render,

+
 createRoot,

 
 events

} from '@react-three/fiber'



-
 render(<mesh />, canvas, { event })

+
 createRoot(canvas).configure({ events }).render(<mesh />)



Here is a typical setup:


import
 
*
 
as
 
THREE
 
from
 
'three'


import
 
{
 extend
,
 createRoot
,
 events 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




extend
(
THREE
)




const
 root 
=
 
createRoot
(
document
.
querySelector
(
'#root'
)
)




window
.
addEventListener
(
'resize'
,
 
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  root
.
configure
(
{


    events
,


    
camera
:
 
{
 
position
:
 
[
0
,
 
0
,
 
50
]
,
 
fov
:
 
50
 
}
,


    
size
:
 
{
 
width
:
 
window
.
innerWidth
,
 
height
:
 
window
.
innerHeight
 
}
,


  
}
)


  root
.
render
(
<
App
 
/>
)


}
)


window
.
dispatchEvent
(
new
 
Event
(
'resize'
)
)




// This is how you would unmount the root


// root.unmount()




Examples


This is a custom-renderer example using the createRoot api:




Tree-shaking via extend


The underlying reconciler no longer pulls in the THREE namespace automatically.


This enables a granular catalogue and tree-shaking via the 
extend
 API:


import
 
{
 extend
,
 createRoot 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
Mesh
,
 
BoxGeometry
,
 
MeshStandardMaterial
 
}
 
from
 
'three'




extend
(
{
 
Mesh
,
 
BoxGeometry
,
 
MeshStandardMaterial
 
}
)




createRoot
(
canvas
)
.
render
(


  
<
mesh
>


    
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


    
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


  
</
mesh
>
,


)




There's an 
official babel plugin
 which will do this for you automatically:


// In:




import
 
{
 createRoot 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




createRoot
(
canvasNode
)
.
render
(


  
<
mesh
>


    
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


    
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


  
</
mesh
>
,


)




// Out:




import
 
{
 createRoot
,
 extend 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
Mesh
 
as
 _Mesh
,
 
BoxGeometry
 
as
 _BoxGeometry
,
 
MeshStandardMaterial
 
as
 _MeshStandardMaterial 
}
 
from
 
'three'




extend
(
{


  
Mesh
:
 _Mesh
,


  
BoxGeometry
:
 _BoxGeometry
,


  
MeshStandardMaterial
:
 _MeshStandardMaterial
,


}
)




createRoot
(
canvasNode
)
.
render
(


  
<
mesh
>


    
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


    
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


  
</
mesh
>
,


)




No changes are necessary for 
@react-three/test-renderer
 as THREE is extended automatically.


createPortal creates a state enclave


createPortal
 allows you to write a declarative JSX scene into a pre-existing, foreign object. This has been very useful for portals, heads-up displays, view-cubes, view splitting, etc.


But these things were very limited and lacked event support as well as support for eco-system packages (for instance putting OrbitControls into a split view).


With this release 
createPortal
 creates a virtual state-model in which everything keeps functioning. Events work, you can use any 3rd party eco-system control and throw it in there.


The event layering part of this was submitted by 
@theatre_js
 and 
@AndrewPrifer
 üéâ.


import
 
{
 createPortal 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
HeadsUpDisplay
(
{
 children 
}
)
 
{


  
const
 
[
scene
]
 
=
 
useState
(
(
)
 
=>
 
new
 
THREE
.
Scene
(
)
)


  
return
 
createPortal
(
children
,
 scene
,
 
{


    
/* Override RootState here */


  
}
)


}




The event system in particular can now be layered, so that you can have portals inside portals with event priority. You can also inject objects into RootState right away, these will become the defaults inside the portalled state world and anything using 
useThree
 inside will receive these objects.


Here is an example of a layered portal:


createPortal
(
children
,
 scene
,
 
{


  
camera
:
 myCustomCamera
,


  
events
:
 
{


    
priority
:
 previousPriority 
-
 
1
,


    
compute
:
 
(
event
,
 state
,
 previous
)
 
=>
 
{


      
// First we call the previous state-onion-layers compute, this is what makes it possible to nest portals


      
if
 
(
!
previous
.
raycaster
.
camera
)
 previous
.
events
.
compute
(
event
,
 previous
,
 previous
.
previousRoot
.
getState
(
)
)


      
// We run a quick check against the textured plane itself, if it isn't hit there's no need to raycast at all


      
const
 
[
intersection
]
 
=
 previous
.
raycaster
.
intersectObject
(
ref
.
current
)


      
if
 
(
!
intersection
)
 
return
 
false


      
// We take that hits uv coords, set up this layers raycaster, et voil√†, we have raycasting with perspective shift


      
const
 uv 
=
 intersection
.
uv


      state
.
raycaster
.
setFromCamera
(
state
.
pointer
.
set
(
uv
.
x
 
*
 
2
 
-
 
1
,
 uv
.
y
 
*
 
2
 
-
 
1
)
,
 camera
)


    
}
,


  
}
,


}
)




createPortal
 can still be considered low-level and the exact API for 
compute
 is still experimental at this point. Expect ready-made components for portals, hud's and view-splitting to come to drei soon.

Events
All the events you can hook up to
three.js
 objects that implement their own 
raycast
 method (meshes, lines, etc) can be interacted with by declaring events on them. We support pointer events, clicks and wheel-scroll. Events contain the browser event as well as the 
three.js
 event data (object, point, distance, etc). You may want to 
polyfill
 them, if that's a concern.


Additionally, there's a special 
onUpdate
 that is called every time the object gets fresh props, which is good for things like 
self => (self.verticesNeedUpdate = true)
.


Also notice the 
onPointerMissed
 on the canvas element, which fires on clicks that haven't hit 
any
 meshes.

How the event-system works, bubbling and capture


pointerenter
 and 
pointerleave
 events work exactly the same as pointerover and pointerout.

pointerenter
 and 
pointerleave
 semantics are not implemented.


Some events (such as 
pointerout
) happen when there is no intersection between 
eventObject
 and
the ray. When this happens, the event will contain intersection data from a previous event with
this object.


Event propagation (bubbling)


Propagation works a bit differently to the DOM because objects can occlude each other in 3D. The 
intersections
 array in the event includes all objects intersecting the ray, not just the nearest. Only the first intersection with each object is included.
The event is first delivered to the object nearest the camera, and then bubbles up through its ancestors like in the DOM. After that, it is delivered to the next nearest object, and then its ancestors, and so on. This means objects are transparent to pointer events by default, even if the object handles the event.


event.stopPropagation()
 doesn't just stop this event from bubbling up, it also stops it from being delivered to farther objects (objects behind this one). All other objects, nearer or farther, no longer count as being hit while the pointer is over this object. If they were previously delivered pointerover events, they will immediately be delivered pointerout events. If you want an object to block pointer events from objects behind it, it needs to have an event handler as follows:


onPointerOver
=
{
e
 
=>
 
{


  e
.
stopPropagation
(
)


  
// ...


}
}




even if you don't want this object to respond to the pointer event. If you do want to handle the event as well as using 
stopPropagation()
, remember that the pointerout events will happen 
during
 the 
stopPropagation()
 call. You probably want your other event handling to happen after this.


Pointer capture


Because events go to all intersected objects, capturing the pointer also works differently. In the DOM, the capturing object 
replaces
 the hit test, but in React Three Fiber, the capturing object is 
added
 to the hit test result: if the capturing object was not hit, then all of the hit objects (and their ancestors) get the event first, followed by the capturing object and its ancestors. The capturing object can also use 
event.stopPropagation()
 so that objects that really were hit get pointerout events.


Note that you can access the 
setPointerCapture
 and 
releasePointerCapture
 methods 
only
 via 
event.target
: they don't get added to the 
Object3D
 instances in the scene graph.


setPointerCapture
 and 
releasePointerCapture
 take a 
pointerId
 parameter like in the DOM, but for now they don't have support for multiple active pointers. PRs are welcome!

(
)


  
// Optionally release capture


  e
.

.
releasePointerCapture
(
e
.
pointerId
)


}
}




Customizing the event settings


For some advanced usage it's possible to customize the setting of the event manager globally with the 
events
 prop on 
<Canvas/>
:


import
 
{
 
Canvas
,
 events 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




const
 eventManagerFactory
:
 
Parameters
<
typeof
 
Canvas
>
[
0
]
[
'events'
]
 
=
 
(
state
)
 
=>
 
(
{


  
// Default configuration


  
...
events
(
state
)
,




  
// Determines if the event layer is active


  enabled
:
 
true
,




  
// Event layer priority, higher prioritized layers come first and may stop(-propagate) lower layer


  priority
:
 
1
,




  
// The filter can re-order or re-structure the intersections


  
filter
:
 
(
items
:
 
THREE
.
Intersection
[
]
,
 state
:
 
RootState
)
 
=>
 items
,




  
// The compute defines how pointer events are translated into the raycaster and pointer vector2


  
compute
:
 
(
event
:
 
DomEvent
,
 state
:
 
RootState
,
 previous
?
:
 
RootState
)
 
=>
 
{


    state
.
pointer
.
set
(
(
event
.
offsetX
 
/
 state
.
size
.
width
)
 
*
 
2
 
-
 
1
,
 
-
(
event
.
offsetY
 
/
 state
.
size
.
height
)
 
*
 
2
 
+
 
1
)


    state
.
raycaster
.
setFromCamera
(
state
.
pointer
,
 state
.
camera
)


  
}
,




  
// Find more configuration default on ./packages/fiber/src/web/events.ts


  
// And type definitions in ./packages/fiber/src/core/events.ts


}
)




function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
 
events
=
{
eventManagerFactory
}
>


}



Using a different target element


There are cases in which you may want to connect the event handlers to another DOM element instead of the canvas. This is usually done to have events on a shared parent, which allows both the canvas, and dom overlays to receive events.


You can either use the event manager:


const
 
events
 
=>
 
useThree
(
state
 
=>
 state
.
events
)


useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  state
.
events
.
connect
(
domNode
)




Or, the 
eventSource
 shortcut on the canvas (DOM only), which accepts dom-nodes and React.RefObjects to dom-nodes.


function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
const
 target 
=
 
useRef
(
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
div
 
ref
=
{
target
}
>


      
<
Canvas
 
eventSource
=
{
target
.
current
}
>




Using a different prefix (DOM only)


By default Fiber will use offsetX/offsetY to set up the raycaster. You can change this with the 
eventPrefix
 shortcut.


function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
 
eventPrefix
=
"
client
"
>




Allow raycast without user interaction


By default Fiber will only raycast when the user is interacting with the canvas. If, for instance, the camera moves a hoverable object underneath the cursor it will not trigger a hover event. If this is wanted behaviour you can force a raycast by executing 
update()
, call it whenever necessary.


const
 
events
 
=>
 
useThree
(
state
 
=>
 state
.
events
)


useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
// Will trigger a onPointerMove with the last-known pointer event


  state
.
events
.
update
(
)




You can abstract this into more complex logic.


function
 
RaycastWhenCameraMoves
(
)
 
{


  
const
 matrix 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Matrix4
(
)


  
useFrame
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 
{


    
// Act only when the camera has moved


    
if
 
(
!
matrix
.
equals
(
state
.
camera
.
matrixWorld
)
)
 
{


      state
.
events
.
update
(
)


      matrix
.
copy
(
state
.
camera
.
matrixWorld
)


    
}


  
}
)


}

Your first scene
This guide will help you setup your first React Three Fiber scene and introduce you to its core concepts.
This tutorial will assume some React knowledge.


Setting up the Canvas


We'll start by importing the 
<Canvas />
 component from 
@react-three/fiber
 and putting it in our React tree.


import
 
{
 createRoot 
}
 
from
 
'react-dom/client'


import
 
{
 
Canvas
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
div
 
id
=
"
canvas-container
"
>


      
<
Canvas
 
/>


    
</
div
>


  
)


}




createRoot
(
document
.
getElementById
(
'root'
)
)
.
render
(
<
App
 
/>
)




The Canvas component does some important setup work behind the scenes:




It sets up a 
Scene
 and a 
Camera
, the basic building blocks necessary for rendering


It renders our scene every frame, you do not need a traditional render-loop




Canvas is responsive to fit the parent node, so you can control how big it is by changing the parents width and
height, in this case #canvas-container.


Adding a Mesh Component


To actually see something in our scene, we'll add a lowercase 
<mesh />
 native element, which is the direct equivalent to new THREE.Mesh().


<
Canvas
>


  
<
mesh 
/
>




Note that we don't need to import anything, All three.js objects will be treated as native JSX elements, just like you
can just write <div /> or <span /> in regular ReactDOM. The general rule is that Fiber components are
available under the camel-case version of their name in three.js.


A 
Mesh
 is a basic scene object in three.js, and it's used to hold the geometry and the material needed to represent a shape in 3D space.
We'll create a new mesh using a 
BoxGeometry
 and a 
MeshStandardMaterial
 which 
automatically attach
 to their parent.


<
Canvas
>


  
<
mesh
>


    
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


    
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


  
</
mesh
>




Let's pause for a moment to understand exactly what is happening here. The code we just wrote is the equivalent to this three.js code:


const
 scene 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Scene
(
)


const
 camera 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
PerspectiveCamera
(
75
,
 width 
/
 height
,
 
0.1
,
 
1000
)




const
 renderer 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
WebGLRenderer
(
)


renderer
.
setSize
(
width
,
 height
)


document
.
querySelector
(
'#canvas-container'
)
.
appendChild
(
renderer
.
domElement
)




const
 mesh 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Mesh
(
)


mesh
.
geometry
 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
BoxGeometry
(
)


mesh
.
material
 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
MeshStandardMaterial
(
)




scene
.
add
(
mesh
)




function
 
animate
(
)
 
{


  
requestAnimationFrame
(
animate
)


  renderer
.
render
(
scene
,
 camera
)


}




animate
(
)




Constructor arguments


According to the 
docs for 
BoxGeometry
 we can optionally pass three arguments for: width, length and depth:


new
 
THREE
.
BoxGeometry
(
2
,
 
2
,
 
2
)




In order to do this in Fiber we use the 
args
 prop, which 
always
 takes an array whose items represent the constructor arguments.


<
boxGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
2
,
 
2
,
 
2
]
}
 
/>




Note that every time you change args, the object must be re-constructed!


Adding lights


Next, we will add some lights to our scene, by putting these components into our canvas.


<
Canvas
>


  
<
ambientLight
 
intensity
=
{
0.1
}
 
/>


  
<
directionalLight
 
color
=
"
red
"
 
position
=
{
[
0
,
 
0
,
 
5
]
}
 
/>




Props


This introduces us to the last fundamental concept of Fiber, how React 
props
 work on three.js objects. When you set any prop on a Fiber component, it will set the property of the same name on the three.js instance.


Let's focus on our 
ambientLight
, whose 
documentation
 tells us that we can optionally construct it with a color, but it can also receive props.


<
ambientLight
 
intensity
=
{
0.1
}
 
/>




Which is the equivalent to:


const
 light 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
AmbientLight
(
)


light
.
intensity
 
=
 
0.1




Shortcuts


There are a few shortcuts for props that have a 
.set()
 method (colors, vectors, etc).


const
 light 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
DirectionalLight
(
)


light
.
position
.
set
(
0
,
 
0
,
 
5
)


light
.
color
.
set
(
'red'
)




Which is the same as the following in JSX:


<
directionalLight
 
position
=
{
[
0
,
 
0
,
 
5
]
}
 
color
=
"
red
"
 
/>




Please refer to the API for 
a deeper explanation
.


The result


<
Canvas
>


  
<
ambientLight
 
intensity
=
{
0.1
}
 
/>


  
<
directionalLight
 
color
=
"
red
"
 
position
=
{
[
0
,
 
0
,
 
5
]
}
 
/>


  
<
mesh
>


    
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


    
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


  
</
mesh
>


</
Canvas
>

Events and Interaction
Let's make our meshes react to user input.
This tutorial will assume some React knowledge, and will be based on 
this starter codesandbox
, so just fork it and follow along!


After we have our continuous loop running the next step would be to allow our mesh to react to user interaction, so in this part let's attach a click handler to the cube and make it bigger on click.


User Interaction


Any Object3D that has a raycast method can receive a large number of events, for instance a mesh:


<
mesh


  
onClick
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'click'
)
}


  
onContextMenu
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'context menu'
)
}


  
onDoubleClick
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'double click'
)
}


  
onWheel
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'wheel spins'
)
}


  
onPointerUp
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'up'
)
}


  
onPointerDown
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'down'
)
}


  
onPointerOver
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'over'
)
}


  
onPointerOut
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'out'
)
}


  
onPointerEnter
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'enter'
)
}


  
onPointerLeave
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'leave'
)
}


  
onPointerMove
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'move'
)
}


  
onPointerMissed
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'missed'
)
}


  
onUpdate
=
{
(
self
)
 
=>
 
console
.
log
(
'props have been updated'
)
}


/>




From this we can see that what we need to do is use the old 
onClick
 event we use on any DOM element to react to a user clicking the mesh.


Let's add it then:


<
mesh
 
onClick
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
alert
(
'Hellooo'
)
}
 
ref
=
{
myMesh
}
>


  
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


  
<
meshPhongMaterial
 
color
=
"
royalblue
"
 
/>


</
mesh
>




We did it! We created the most boring interaction in the story of 3D and we made an alert show up. Now let's make it actually animate our mesh.


Let's start by setting some state to check if the mesh is active:


const
 
[
active
,
 setActive
]
 
=
 
useState
(
false
)




After we have this we can set the scale with a ternary operator like so:


<
mesh
 
scale
=
{
active 
?
 
1.5
 
:
 
1
}
 
onClick
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
setActive
(
!
active
)
}
 
ref
=
{
myMesh
}
>


  
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


  
<
meshPhongMaterial
 
color
=
"
royalblue
"
 
/>


</
mesh
>




If you try to click on your mesh now, it scales up and down. We just made our first interactive 3D mesh!


What we did in this chapter was:




Attached a click handler to our mesh


Added some state to track if the mesh is currently active


Changed the scale based on that state




interaction


Exercises




Change other props of the mesh like the 
position
 or even the 
color
 of the material.


Use 
onPointerOver
 and 
onPointerOut
 to change the props of the mesh on hover events.




Next steps


We just made our mesh react to user interaction but it looks pretty bland without any transition, right?
In the next chapter let's integrate 
react-spring
 into our project to make this into an actual animation.

How does it work?
Hooks
Hooks are the heart of react-three-fiber
Hooks allow you to tie or request specific information to your component. For instance, components that want to participate in the renderloop can use 
useFrame
, components that need to be informed of three.js specifics can use 
useThree
 and so on. All hooks clean up after themselves once the component unmounts.


Hooks can only be used inside the Canvas element because they rely on context!


‚ùå You cannot expect something like this to work:


import
 
{
 useThree 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
const
 
{
 size 
}
 
=
 
useThree
(
)
 
// This will just crash


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
>


      
<
mesh
>




‚úÖ Do this instead:


function
 
Foo
(
)
 
{


  
const
 
{
 size 
}
 
=
 
useThree
(
)


  
...


}




function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
>


      
<
Foo
 
/>




useThree


This hook gives you access to the state model which contains the default renderer, the scene, your camera, and so on. It also gives you the current size of the canvas in screen and viewport coordinates.


import
 
{
 useThree 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
Foo
(
)
 
{


  
const
 state 
=
 
useThree
(
)




The hook is reactive, if you resize the browser for instance, you get fresh measurements, same applies to any of the state objects that may change.

Selector


You can also select properties, this allows you to avoid needless re-render for components that are interested only in particulars. Reactivity does not include deeper three.js internals!


// Will only trigger re-render when the default camera is exchanged


const
 camera 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
camera
)


// Will only re-render on resize changes


const
 viewport 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
viewport
)


// ‚ùå You cannot expect reactivity from three.js internals!


const
 zoom 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
camera
.
zoom
)




Reading state from outside of the component cycle


function
 
Foo
(
)
 
{


  
const
 get 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
get
)


  
...


  
get
(
)
 
// Get fresh state from anywhere you want




Exchanging defaults


function
 
Foo
(
)
 
{


  
const
 set 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
set
)


  
...


  
useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


    
set
(
{
 
camera
:
 
new
 
THREE
.
OrthographicCamera
(
...
)
 
}
)


  
}
,
 
[
]
)




useFrame


This hook allows you to execute code on every rendered frame, like running effects, updating controls, and so on. You receive the state (same as 
useThree
) and a clock delta. Your callback function will be invoked just before a frame is rendered. When the component unmounts it is unsubscribed automatically from the render-loop.


import
 
{
 useFrame 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
Foo
(
)
 
{


  
useFrame
(
(
state
,
 delta
,
 xrFrame
)
 
=>
 
{


    
// This function runs at the native refresh rate inside of a shared render-loop


  
}
)




Be careful about what you do inside useFrame! You should never setState in there! Your calculations should be slim and
you should mind all the commonly known pitfalls when dealing with loops in general, like re-use of variables, etc.


Taking over the render-loop


If you need more control you may pass a numerical 
renderPriority
 value. This will cause React Three Fiber to disable automatic rendering altogether. It will now be your responsibility to render, which is useful when you're working with effect composers, heads-up displays, etc.


function
 
Render
(
)
 
{


  
// Takes over the render-loop, the user has the responsibility to render


  
useFrame
(
(
{
 gl
,
 scene
,
 camera 
}
)
 
=>
 
{


    gl
.
render
(
scene
,
 camera
)


  
}
,
 
1
)




function
 
RenderOnTop
(
)
 
{


  
// This will execute *after* Render's useframe


  
useFrame
(
(
{
 gl
,
 
...
 
}
)
 
=>
 
{


    gl
.
render
(
...
)


  
}
,
 
2
)




Callbacks will be executed in order of ascending priority values (lowest first, highest last.), similar to the DOM's
z-order.


Negative indices


Using negative indices will 
not take over the render loop
, but it can be useful if you really must order the sequence of useFrames across the component tree.


function
 
A
(
)
 
{


  
// This will execute first


  
useFrame
(
(
)
 
=>
 
...
,
 
-
2
)




function
 
B
(
)
 
{


  
// This useFrame will execute *after* A's


  
useFrame
(
(
)
 
=>
 
...
,
 
-
1
)




useLoader


This hook loads assets and suspends for easier fallback- and error-handling. It can take any three.js loader as its first argument: GLTFLoader, OBJLoader, TextureLoader, FontLoader, etc. It is based on 
React.Suspense
, so fallback-handling and 
error-handling
 happen at the parental level.


import
 
{
 
Suspense
 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 useLoader 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
GLTFLoader
 
}
 
from
 
'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'




function
 
Model
(
)
 
{


  
const
 result 
=
 
useLoader
(
GLTFLoader
,
 
'/model.glb'
)


  
// You don't need to check for the presence of the result, when we're here


  
// the result is guaranteed to be present since useLoader suspends the component


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
object
=
{
result
.
scene
}
 
/>


}




function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Suspense
 
fallback
=
{
<
FallbackComponent
 
/>
 
/* or null */
}
>


      
<
Model
 
/>


    
</
Suspense
>


  
)


}




Assets loaded with useLoader are cached by default. The urls given serve as cache-keys. This allows you to re-use
loaded data everywhere in the component tree.


Be very careful with mutating or disposing of loaded assets, especially when you plan to re-use them. Refer to the
automatic disposal section in the API.


Loader extensions


You can provide a callback as the third argument if you need to configure your loader:


import
 
{
 
DRACOLoader
 
}
 
from
 
'three/examples/jsm/loaders/DRACOLoader'




useLoader
(
GLTFLoader
,
 url
,
 
(
loader
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 dracoLoader 
=
 
new
 
DRACOLoader
(
)


  dracoLoader
.
setDecoderPath
(
'/draco-gltf/'
)


  loader
.
setDRACOLoader
(
dracoLoader
)


}
)




Loading multiple assets at once


It can also make multiple requests in parallel:


const
 
[
bumpMap
,
 specMap
,
 normalMap
]
 
=
 
useLoader
(
TextureLoader
,
 
[
url1
,
 url2
,
 url2
]
)




Loading status


You can get the loading status from a callback you provide as the fourth argument. Though consider alternatives like THREE.DefaultLoadingManager or better yet, 
Drei's
 loading helpers.


useLoader
(
loader
,
 url
,
 extensions
,
 
(
xhr
)
 
=>
 
{


  
console
.
log
(
(
xhr
.
loaded
 
/
 xhr
.
total
)
 
*
 
100
 
+
 
'% loaded'
)


}
)




Special treatment of GLTFLoaders and all loaders that return a scene prop


If a 
result.scene
 prop is found the hook will automatically create a object & material collection: 
{ nodes, materials }
. This lets you build immutable scene graphs selectively. You can also specifically alter the data without having to traverse it. 
GLTFJSX
 specifically relies on this data.


const
 
{
 nodes
,
 materials 
}
 
=
 
useLoader
(
GLTFLoader
,
 url
)




Pre-loading assets


You can pre-load assets in global space so that models can be loaded in anticipation before they're mounted in the component tree.


useLoader
.
preload
(
GLTFLoader
,
 
'/model.glb'
 
/* extensions */
)




useGraph


Convenience hook which creates a memoized, named object/material collection from any 
Object3D
.


import
 
{
 useLoader
,
 useGraph 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
Model
(
url
)
 
{


  
const
 scene 
=
 
useLoader
(
OBJLoader
,
 url
)


  
const
 
{
 nodes
,
 materials 
}
 
=
 
useGraph
(
scene
)


  
return
 
<
mesh
 
geometry
=
{
nodes
.
robot
.
geometry
}
 
material
=
{
materials
.
metal
}
 
/>


}

How does it work?
How does it work?
This is an advanced guide on the inner workings of Fiber, if you are just getting started, take a look at our introduction!
React Three Fiber is a React 
renderer
 for 
three.js
.


This means that each Fiber component will effectively create a new THREE object that will be added to a 
scene
.
Understanding how this works is not necessarily needed to use Fiber, but it will better arm you to deal with anything that you might need in your projects, reading other people's Fiber code and even help you contribute.


Let's take a small React example:


import
 
{
 
Canvas
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
MyApp
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
>


      
<
group
>


        
<
mesh
>


          
<
meshNormalMaterial
 
/>


          
<
boxGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
2
,
 
2
,
 
2
]
}
 
/>


        
</
mesh
>


      
</
group
>


    
</
Canvas
>


  
)


}




In three.js, this is equivalent to:


import
 
*
 
as
 
THREE
 
from
 
'three'




const
 scene 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Scene
(
)
 
// <Canvas>




const
 group 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Group
(
)
 
// <group>




const
 mesh 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Mesh
(
)
 
// <mesh />


const
 material 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
MeshNormalMaterial
(
)
 
// <meshNormalMaterial />


const
 geometry 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
BoxGeometry
(
2
,
 
2
,
 
2
)
 
// <boxGeometry />




mesh
.
material
 
=
 material

mesh
.
geometry
 
=
 geometry



group
.
add
(
mesh
)


scene
.
add
(
group
)




Our 
Canvas
 element will create a new scene, and Fiber will instantiate new objects for each component and correctly compose them together in a scene graph!


Additionally, Fiber will:




Setup a new perspective camera at [0, 0, 0] and set it as default


Setup a 
render loop
 with automatic render to screen


Setup pointer events via raycasting on all meshes with 
onPointer
 props


Setup tone mapping


Automatically handle window resize




Let's break this down!


Creating THREE objects


In three.js, we can create new object using the classic JS API:


const
 myBox 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
BoxGeometry
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
)




Object creation is handled transparently by the Fiber renderer, the name of the constructor 
BoxGeometry
 is equivalent to the camel case component 
<boxGeometry />
, while the constructor arguments - in our example 
[1, 2, 3]
 - are passed via the 
args
 prop:


<
boxGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
]
}
 
/>




Note that the object will be created only when first adding the component to the React tree!


The 
attach
 props


Fiber always tries to correctly infer the relationship between components and their parents, for example:


<
group
>


  
<
mesh
 
/>


</
group
>




Here, we always know that a group can only have children, so Fiber just calls the 
add
 method on the group:


group
.
add
(
mesh
)




For meshes and other three.js objects, rules can be different. Looking at the three.js documentation, we can see how a 
THREE.Mesh
 object is constructed using a 
material
 and a 
geometry
.


With the 
attach
 prop, we can precisely tell the renderer what property to attach each component to:


<
mesh
>


  
<
meshNormalMaterial
 
attach
=
"
material
"
 
/>


  
<
boxGeometry
 
attach
=
"
geometry
"
 
/>


</
mesh
>




This will 
explicitly
 tell Fiber to render like this:


mesh
.
material
 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
MeshNormalMaterial
(
)


mesh
.
geometry
 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
BoxGeometry
(
)




As you can see, the 
attach
 prop is telling Fiber to set the parent's 
material
 property to a reference to our 
<meshNormalMaterial />
 object.


Note that while we used geometry and material for this example, Fiber also infers the attach property from the
constructor name, so anything with 
material
 or 
geometry
 will automatically get attached to the correct property of
its parent.


Props


With Fiber, you can pass any three.js property as a React property, and it will be assigned to the constructed object:


<
meshBasicMaterial
 
color
=
"
red
"
 
/>




is equivalent to:


const
 material 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
MeshBasicMaterial
(
)


material
.
color
 
=
 
'red'




Fiber will check the type of the property value and either:




assign the new value directly


if the value is an object with a 
set
 method, call that


construct a new object if needed.


convert between formats




<
mesh
 
scale
=
{
[
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
]
}
 
/>




is equivalent to:


const
 mesh 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Mesh
(
)


mesh
.
scale
 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Vector3
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
)




// on update, it will instead `set()` the vector


mesh
.
scale
.
set
(
3
,
 
4
,
 
5
)




Pointer Events


Pointer Events
 are transparently handled by Fiber. On startup, it will create a 
raycaster
 for mouse picking.


Every object with 
onPointer
 props will be added to the array of objects checked every frame by the raycaster:


<
mesh
 
onPointerDown
=
{
console
.
log
}
>
...
</
mesh
>




The ray's 
origin
 and 
direction
 are updated every time the mouse moves on the 
<Canvas />
 element or the window is resized.
Fiber also handles camera switching, meaning that the raycaster will always use the currently active camera.


When using the 
raycast
 prop, the object will instead be picked using a custom ray:


import
 
{
 useCamera 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'




return
 
<
mesh
 
raycast
=
{
useCamera
(
anotherCamera
)
}
 
/>




Render Loop


By default, Fiber will setup a render loop that renders the default 
scene
 from the default 
camera
 to a 
WebGLRenderer
.


The loop is setup using 
setAnimationLoop
, which will execute its callback every time a new frame is renderable. This is what will happen every render:




All global before effects are executed


Clock delta is saved - implying all 
useFrame
 calls will share the same 
delta


useFrame
 callbacks are executed in order


renderer.render(scene, camera)
 is called, effectively rendering the scene to screen


All global after effects are executed

Using with TypeScript
This guide will help through common scenarios and how to approach them with TypeScript.
This tutorial will assume some React and TypeScript knowledge. You can fork and follow along from 
this starter codesandbox
.


Typing with useRef


React's 
useRef
 won't automatically infer types despite pointing it to a typed ref.


You can type the ref yourself by passing a type through 
useRef
's generics:


import
 
{
 useRef
,
 useEffect 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
Mesh
 
}
 
from
 
'three'




function
 
Box
(
props
)
 
{


  
const
 meshRef 
=
 
useRef
<
Mesh
>
(
null
!
)




  
useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


    
console
.
log
(
Boolean
(
meshRef
.
current
)
)


  
}
,
 
[
]
)




  
return
 
(


    
<
mesh
 
{
...
props
}
 
ref
=
{
meshRef
}
>


      
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


      
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
/>


    
</
mesh
>


  
)


}




The exclamation mark is a non-null assertion that will let TS know that 
ref.current
 is defined when we access it in effects.


Typing shorthand props


react-three-fiber accepts short-hand props like scalars, strings, and arrays so you can declaratively set properties without side effects.


Here are the different variations of props:


import
 
{
 
Euler
,
 
Vector3
,
 
Color
 
}
 
from
 
'three'




rotation
:
 
Euler
 
||
 
[
x
,
 y
,
 z
]


position
:
 
Vector3
 
||
 
[
x
,
 y
,
 z
]
 
||
 scalar

color
:
 
Color
 
||
 
'hotpink'
 
||
 
0xffffff




Each property has extended types which you can pull from to type these properties.


import
 
{
 
Euler
,
 
Vector3
,
 
Color
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


// or


// import { ReactThreeFiber } from '@react-three/fiber'


// ReactThreeFiber.Euler, ReactThreeFiber.Vector3, etc.




rotation
:
 
Euler


position
:
 
Vector3


color
:
 
Color




This is particularly useful if you are typing properties outside of components, such as a store or a hook.


Extend usage


react-three-fiber can also accept third-party elements and extend them into its internal catalogue.


import
 
{
 useRef
,
 useEffect 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
GridHelper
 
}
 
from
 
'three'


import
 
{
 extend 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




// Create our custom element


class
 
CustomElement
 
extends
 
GridHelper
 
{
}




// Extend so the reconciler will learn about it


extend
(
{
 
CustomElement
 
}
)




The catalogue teaches the underlying reconciler how to create fibers for these elements and treat them within the scene.


You can then declaratively create custom elements with primitives, but TypeScript won't know about them nor their props.


// error: 'customElement' does not exist on type 'JSX.IntrinsicElements'



<
customElement
 
/>




Node Helpers


react-three-fiber exports helpers that you can use to define different types of nodes. These nodes will type an element that we'll attach to the global JSX namespace.


Node


Object3DNode


BufferGeometryNode


MaterialNode


LightNode




Extending ThreeElements


Since our custom element is an object, we'll use 
Object3DNode
 to define it.


import
 
{
 useRef
,
 useEffect 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
GridHelper
 
}
 
from
 
'three'


import
 
{
 extend
,
 
Object3DNode
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




// Create our custom element


class
 
CustomElement
 
extends
 
GridHelper
 
{
}




// Extend so the reconciler will learn about it


extend
(
{
 
CustomElement
 
}
)




// Add types to ThreeElements elements so primitives pick up on it


declare
 
module
 
'@react-three/fiber'
 
{


  
interface
 
ThreeElements
 
{


    customElement
:
 
Object3DNode
<
CustomElement
,
 
typeof
 
CustomElement
>


  
}


}




// react-three-fiber will create your custom component and TypeScript will understand it


<
customComponent
 
/>




Exported types


react-three-fiber is extensible and exports types for its internals, such as render props, canvas props, and events:


// Event raycaster intersection


Intersection




// `useFrame` internal subscription and render callback


Subscription


RenderCallback




// `useThree`'s returned internal state


RootState


Performance


Dpr


Size


Viewport


Camera




// Canvas props


Props




// Supported events


Events




// Event manager signature (is completely modular)


EventManager




// Wraps a platform event as it's passed through the event manager

Render defaults


Canvas uses 
createRoot
 which will create a translucent 
THREE.WebGLRenderer
 with the following constructor args:




antialias=true


alpha=true


powerPreference="high-performance"




and with the following properties:




outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace


toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping




It will also create the following scene internals:




A 
THREE.Perspective
 camera


A 
THREE.Orthographic
 cam if 
orthographic
 is true


A 
THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap
 if 
shadows
 is true


A 
THREE.Scene
 (into which all the JSX is rendered) and a 
THREE.Raycaster




In recent versions of threejs, 
THREE.ColorManagement.enabled
 will be set to 
true
 to enable automatic conversion of colors according to the renderer's configured color space. R3F will handle texture color space conversion. For more on this topic, see 
https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Color-management
.


Custom Canvas


R3F can render to a root, similar to how 
react-dom
 and all the other React renderers work. This allows you to shave off 
react-dom
 (~40kb), 
react-use-measure
 (~3kb) and, if you don't need them, 
pointer-events
 (~7kb) (you need to explicitly import 
events
 and add them to the config otherwise).


Roots have the same options and properties as 
Canvas
, but you are responsible for resizing it. It requires an existing DOM 
<canvas>
 object into which it renders.


CreateRoot


Creates a root targeting a canvas, rendering JSX.


import
 
*
 
as
 
THREE
 
from
 
'three'


import
 
{
 extend
,
 createRoot
,
 events 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




// Register the THREE namespace as native JSX elements.


// See below for notes on tree-shaking


extend
(

Tree-shaking


New with v8, the underlying reconciler no longer pulls in the THREE namespace automatically.


This enables a granular catalogue which also enables tree-shaking via the 
extend
 API:


import
 
{
 extend
,
 createRoot 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
Mesh
,
 
BoxGeometry
,
 
MeshStandardMaterial
 
}
 
from
 
'three'




extend
(
{
 
Mesh
,
 
BoxGeometry
,
 
MeshStandardMaterial
 
}
)




createRoot
(
canvas
)
.
render
(


  
<
>


    
<
mesh
>


      
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


      
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


    
</
mesh
>


  
</
>
,


)




There's an 
official babel plugin
 which will do this for you automatically:


// In:




import
 
{
 createRoot 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




createRoot
(
canvasNode
)
.
render
(


  
<
mesh
>


    
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


    
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


  
</
mesh
>
,


)




// Out:




import
 
{
 createRoot
,
 extend 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
Mesh
 
as
 _Mesh
,
 
BoxGeometry
 
as
 _BoxGeometry
,
 
MeshStandardMaterial
 
as
 _MeshStandardMaterial 
}
 
from
 
'three'




extend
(
{


  
Mesh
:

,


  
BoxGeometry
:

,


  
MeshStandardMaterial
:

,


}
)




createRoot
(

.
render
(


  
<

>


    
<

/>


    
<

</

,


)

Scaling performance
This is a short primer on how to scale performance.
Running WebGL can be quite expensive depending on how powerful your devices are. In order to mitigate this, especially if you want to make your application available to a broad variety of devices, including weaker options, you should look into performance optimizations. This article goes through a couple of them.


On-demand rendering


three.js apps usually run in a game-loop that executes 60 times a second, React Three Fiber is no different. This is perfectly fine when your scene has 
constantly
 moving parts in it. This is what generally drains batteries the most and makes fans spin up.


But if the moving parts in your scene are allowed to come to rest, then it would be wasteful to keep rendering. In such cases you can opt into on-demand rendering, which will only render when necessary. This saves battery and keeps noisy fans in check.


Open the sandbox below in a full screen and look into dev tools, you will see that it is completely idle when nothing is going on. It renders only when you move the model.


Color grading


All you need to do is set the canvas 
frameloop
 prop to 
demand
. It will render frames whenever it detects prop changes throughout the component tree.


<
Canvas
 
frameloop
=
"
demand
"
>




Triggering manual frames


One major caveat is that if anything in the tree 
mutates
 props, then React cannot be aware of it and the display would be stale. For instance, camera controls just grab into the camera and mutate its values. Here you can use React Three Fiber's 
invalidate
 function to trigger frames manually.


function
 
Controls
(
)
 
{


  
const
 orbitControlsRef 
=
 
useRef
(
)


  
const
 
{
 invalidate
,
 camera
,
 gl 
}
 
=
 
useThree
(
)


  
useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


    orbitControlsRef
.
current
.
addEventListener
(
'change'
,
 invalidate
)


    
return
 
(
)
 
=>
 orbitControlsRef
.
current
.
removeEventListener
(
'change'
,
 invalidate
)


  
}
,
 
[
]
)


  
return
 
<
orbitControls
 
ref
=
{
orbitControlsRef
}
 
args
=
{
[
camera
,
 gl
.
domElement
]
}
 
/>




Drei's controls do this automatically for you.


Generally you can call invalidate whenever you need to render:


invalidate
(
)




Calling 
invalidate()
 will not render immediately, it merely requests a
new frame to be rendered out. Calling invalidate multiple times will not render multiple times.
Think of it as a flag to tell the system that something has changed.


Re-using geometries and materials


Each geometry and material means additional overhead for the GPU. You should try to re-use resources if you know they will repeat.


You could do this globally:


const
 red 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
MeshLambertMaterial
(
{
 
color
:
 
"red"
 
}
)


const
 sphere 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
SphereGeometry
(
1
,
 
28
,
 
28
)




function
 
Scene
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
>


      
<
mesh
 
geometry
=
{
sphere
}
 
material
=
{
red
}
 
/>


      
<
mesh
 
position
=
{
[
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
]
}
 
geometry
=
{
sphere
}
 
material
=
{
red
}
 
/>




If you create a material or color in global space - outside of React Three Fiber's 
Canvas
 context - you should enable 
ColorManagement
 in three.js. This will allow certain conversions (for hexadecimal and CSS colors in sRGB) to be made automatically, producing correct colors in all cases.


import
 
*
 
as
 
THREE
 
from
 
'three'




// r150


THREE
.
ColorManagement
.
enabled
 
=
 
true




// r139-r149


THREE
.
ColorManagement
.
legacyMode
 
=
 
false




Caching with useLoader


Every resource that is loaded with useLoader is cached automatically!


If you access a resource via useLoader with the same URL, throughout the component tree, then you will always refer to the same asset and thereby re-use it. This is especially useful if you run your GLTF assets through 
GLTFJSX
 because it links up geometries and materials and thereby creates re-usable models.


Re-using GLTFs


function
 
Shoe
(
props
)
 
{


  
const
 
{
 nodes
,
 materials 
}
 
=
 
useLoader
(
GLTFLoader
,
 
"/shoe.glb"
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
group
 
{
...
props
}
 
dispose
=
{
null
}
>


      
<
mesh
 
geometry
=
{
nodes
.
shoe
.
geometry
}
 
material
=
{
materials
.
canvas
}
 
/>


    
</
group
>


  
)


}




<
Shoe
 
position
=
{
[
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
]
}
 
/>


<
Shoe
 
position
=
{
[
4
,
 
5
,
 
6
]
}
 
/>




Instancing


Each mesh is a draw call, you should be mindful of how many of these you employ: no more than 1000 as the very maximum, and optimally a few hundred or less. You can win performance back by reducing draw calls, for example by instancing repeating objects. This way you can have hundreds of thousands of objects in a single draw call.


Instances


Setting up instancing is not so hard, consult 
the three.js docs
 if you need help.


function
 
Instances
(
{
 count 
=
 
100000
,
 temp 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Object3D
(
)
 
}
)
 
{


  
const
 instancedMeshRef 
=
 
useRef
(
)


  
useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


    
// Set positions


    
for
 
(
let
 i 
=
 
0
;
 i 
<
 count
;
 i
++
)
 
{


      temp

}


    
// Update the instance


    instancedMeshRef

}
,
 
[

return
 
(

ref
=
{
instancedMeshRef
}
 
args
=
{
[
null
,
 
null
,

]
}
>


      
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


      
<
meshPhongMaterial
 
/>


    
</
instancedMesh
>


  
)


}




Level of detail


Sometimes it can be beneficial to reduce the quality of an object the further it is away from the camera. Why would you display it full resolution if it is barely visible. This can be a good strategy to reduce the overall vertex-count which means less work for the GPU.


Scroll in and out to see the effect:


Re-using geometry and level of detail


There is a small component in Drei called 
<Detailed />
 which sets up LOD without boilerplate. You load or prepare a couple of resolution stages, as many as you like, and then give them the same amount of distances from the camera, starting from highest quality to lowest.


import
 
{
 
Detailed
,
 useGLTF 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'




function
 
Model
(
)
 
{


  
const
 
[
low
,
 mid
,
 high
]
 
=
 
useGLTF
(
[
"/low.glb"
,
 
"/mid.glb"
,
 
"/high.glb"
]
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
Detailed
 
distances
=
{
[
0
,
 
10
,
 
20
]
}
>


      
<
mesh
 
geometry
=
{
high
}
 
/>


      
<
mesh
 
geometry
=
{
mid
}
 
/>


      
<
mesh
 
geometry
=
{
low
}
 
/>


    
<
Detailed
/>


  )

}



Nested loading


Nested loading means that lesser textures and models are loaded first, higher-resolution later.


The following sandbox goes through three loading stages:




A loading indicator


Low quality


High quality




Progressive loading states with suspense


And this is how easy it is to achieve it, you can nest suspense and even use it as a fallback:


function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Suspense
 
fallback
=
{
<
span
>
loading...
</
span
>
}
>


      
<
Canvas
>


        
<
Suspense
 
fallback
=
{
<
Model
 
url
=
"
/low-quality.glb
"
 
/>
}
>


          
<
Model
 
url
=
"
/high-quality.glb
"
 
/>


        
</
Suspense
>


      
</
Canvas
>


    
</
Suspense
>


  
)


}




function
 
Model
(
{
 url 
}
)
 
{


  
const
 
{
 scene 
}
 
=
 
useGLTF
(
url
)


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
object
=
{
scene
}
 
/>


}




Performance monitoring


Drei has a new component 
PerformanceMonitor
 that allows you to monitor, and adapt to, device performance. This component will collect the average fps (frames per second) over time. If after a couple of iterations the averages are below or above a threshold it will trigger onIncline and onDecline callbacks that allow you to respond. Typically you would reduce the quality of your scene, the resolution, effects, the amount of stuff to render, or, increase it if you have enough framerate to fill.


Since this would normally cause ping-ponging between the two callbacks you define upper and lower framerate bounds, as long as you stay within that margin nothing will trigger. Ideally your app should find its way into that margin by gradually altering quality.


A simple example for regulating the resolution. It starts out with 1.5, if the system falls below the bounds it goes to 1, if it's fast enough it goes to 2.


function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
const
 
[
dpr
,
 setDpr
]
 
=
 
useState
(
1.5
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
 
dpr
=
{
dpr
}
>


      
<
PerformanceMonitor
 
onIncline
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
setDpr
(
2
)
}
 
onDecline
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
setDpr
(
1
)
}
 
>




You can also use the onChange callback to get notified when the average changes in whichever direction. This allows you to make gradual changes. It gives you a factor between 0 and 1, which is increased by incline and decreased by decline. The factor is initially 0.5 by default.


import
 
round
 
from
 
'lodash/round'




const
 
[
dpr
,
 set
]
 
=
 
useState
(
1
)


return
 
(


 
<
Canvas
 
dpr
=
{
dpr
}
>


  
<
PerformanceMonitor
 
onChange
=
{
(
{
 factor 
}
)
 
=>
 
setDpr
(
round
(
0.5
 
+
 
1.5
 
*
 factor
,
 
1
)
)
}
>




If you still experience flip flops despite the bounds you can define a limit of flipflops. If it is met onFallback will be triggered which typically sets a lowest possible baseline for the app. After the fallback has been called PerformanceMonitor will shut down.


<
PerformanceMonitor
 
flipflops
=
{
3
}
 
onFallback
=
{
(
)
 
=>
 
setDpr
(
1
)
}
>




PerformanceMonitor can also have children, if you wrap your app in it you get to use usePerformanceMonitor which allows individual components down the nested tree to respond to performance changes on their own.


<
PerformanceMonitor
>


  
<
Effects
 
/>


</
PerformanceMonitor
>




function
 
Effects
(
)
 
{


  
usePerformanceMonitor
(
{
 onIncline
,
 onDecline
,
 onFallback
,
 onChange 
}
)


  
// ...


}




Movement regression


Websites like Sketchfab make sure the scene is always fluid, running at 60 fps, and responsive, no matter which device is being used or how expensive a loaded model is. They do this by regressing movement, where effects, textures, shadows will slightly reduce quality until still-stand


The following sandbox uses expensive lights and post-processing. In order for it to run relatively smooth it will scale the pixel ratio on movement and also skip heavy post-processing effects like ambient occlusion.


Performance scaling


When you inspect the state model you will notice an object called 
performance
.


performance
:
 
{


  
current
:
 
1
,


  
min
:
 
0.1
,


  
max
:
 
1
,


  
debounce
:
 
200
,


  
regress
:
 
(
)
 
=>
 
void
,


}
,






current: Performance factor alternates between min and max


min: Performance lower bound (should be less than 1)


max: Performance upper bound (no higher than 1)


debounce: Debounce timeout until it goes to upper bound (1) again


regress(): Function that temporarily regresses performance




You can define defaults like so:


<
Canvas
 
performance
=
{
{
 
min
:
 
0.5
 
}
}
>
...
</
Canvas
>




This is how you can put the system into regression


The only thing you have to do is call 
regress()
. When exactly you do that, that is up to you, but it could be when the mouse moves, or the scene is moving, for instance when controls fire their change-event.


Say you are using controls, then the following code puts the system in regress when they are active:


const
 regress 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
performance
.
regress
)


useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  controls
.
current
?.
addEventListener
(
'change'
,
 regress
)




This is how you can respond to it


Mere calls to 
regress()
 will not change or affect anything!


Your app has to opt into performance scaling by listening to the performance 
current
! The number itself will tell you what to do. 1 (max) means everything is ok, the default. Less than 1 (min) means a regression is requested and the number itself tells you how far you should go when scaling down.


For instance, you could simply multiply 
current
 with the pixelratio to cut down on resolution. If you have defined 
min: 0.5
 that would mean it will half the resolution for at least 200ms (delay) when regress is called. It can be used for anything else, too: switching off lights when 
current < 1
, using lower-res textures, skip post-processing effects, etc. You could of course also animate/lerp these changes.


Here is a small prototype component that scales the pixel ratio:


function
 
AdaptivePixelRatio
(
)
 
{


  
const
 current 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
performance
.
current
)


  
const
 setPixelRatio 
=
 
useThree
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
setDpr
)


  
useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


    
setPixelRatio
(
window
.
devicePixelRatio
 
*
 current
)


  
}
,
 
[
current
]
)


  
return
 
null


}




Drop this component into the scene, combine it with the code above that calls 
regress()
, and you have adaptive resolution:


<
AdaptivePixelRatio
 
/>




There are pre-made components for this already in the 
Drei library
.


Enable concurrency


React 18 introduces concurrent scheduling, specifically time slicing via 
startTransition
 and 
useTransition
. This will virtualize the component graph, which then allows you to prioritise components and actions. Think of how a virtual list avoids scaling issues because it only renders as many items as the screen can take, it is not affected by the amount of items it has to render, be it 10 or 100.000.000.


React 18 functions very similar to this, it can potentially defer load and heavy tasks in ways that would be hard or impossible to achieve in a vanilla application. It thereby holds on to a stable framerate even in the most demanding situations.


The following benchmark shows how powerful concurrency can be: 
https://github.com/drcmda/scheduler-test


It simulates heavy load by creating hundreds of THREE.TextGeometry instances (510 to be exact). This class, like many others in three.js, is expensive and takes a while to construct. If all 510 instances are created the same time 
it will cause approximately 1.5 seconds of pure jank
 (Apple M1), the tab would normally freeze. It runs in an interval and 
will execute every 2 seconds
.

Using with React Spring
Animating props with ease.
This tutorial will assume some React knowledge, and will be based on 
this starter codesandbox
, so just fork it and follow along!


We learned how to create small animations and also how to react to user interactions, but we haven't yet learned how to change these props in a way to create animations.


For that, we are gonna use 
react-spring
. 
react-spring
 is a spring physics based animation library and it works perfectly with React Three Fiber as it comes from the same maintainers, and it also has exports specifically created for use with React Three Fiber.


Spring Animations


Let's start by defining some concepts about 
react-spring
 as it works with animations in a way you may not be used to. Usually when defining an animation or even a transition in CSS, you tell the code how much time you want the transition to last.


transition
:
 opacity 
200
ms
 ease
;




This is not how 
react-spring
 works, it instead works with 
springs
 and what that means is, the animation's flow depends on things like the mass, tension and friction of what you want to animate, and this is exactly what makes it so perfect to use with 3D.


Using 
react-spring


Let's start by installing it:


npm
 
install
 three @react-spring/three



After that, we import everything from 
@react-spring/three
 as it contains the components that were created specifically for use with React Three Fiber.


We need to import two things from 
react-spring
:


import
 
{
 useSpring
,
 animated 
}
 
from
 
'@react-spring/three'




Let's go over them, shall we?




useSpring
 - A hook to transform values into animated-values


animated
 - A component that is used instead of your DOM or mesh, so instead of using 
mesh
 you will be using 
animated.mesh
 if you want it to be affected by 
react-spring




Let's create our first spring and attach it to our mesh when the user clicks.


const
 springs 
=
 
useSpring
(
{
 
scale
:
 active 
?
 
1.5
 
:
 
1
 
}
)




What we did here is create a constant called 
springs
, this constant will hold the animated values.


useSpring
 itself takes one argument, and that is an object with all the things you want to animate. In this case, we just want to animate the scale and to hop between the value of 1 and the value of 1.5 depending on the active state.


We can also deconstruct the return value of 
useSpring
 and just get the value we want, like so:


const
 
{
 scale 
}
 
=
 
useSpring
(
{
 
scale
:
 active 
?
 
1.5
 
:
 
1
 
}
)




Now that we have this animated value, let's place it in our mesh:


<
animated.mesh
 
scale
=
{
scale
}
 
onClick
=
{
(

</

If you now click on the cube, you can see that it doesn't just jump from one value to the other, but instead it animates smoothly between the two values.


One last touch we might want to add is the wobblier effect to the animation. For that we can import the 
config
 object from 
react-spring
:


import
 
{
 useSpring
,
 animated
,
 config 
}
 
from
 
'@react-spring/three'




Lastly when we call the hook, we can pass a value for config and pass the 
wobbly
 configuration:


const
 
{
 scale 
}
 
=
 
useSpring
(
{


  
scale
:
 active 
?
 
1.5
 
:
 
1
,


  
config
:
 config
.
wobbly
,


}
)




You can check the other configuration options at the 
react-spring
 documentation
.

Testing
How does it work?
Testing
Let's test our 3D Scene
Like with every other application testing is an important factor when it comes to releasing an application into the wild and when it comes to React Three Fiber we can use React Three Test Renderer to achieve this.


We will be testing the 
sandbox
 we created in 
events and interactions
.


How to test React Three Fiber


Let's start by installing the React Three Test Renderer:


npm
 
install
 @react-three/test-renderer --save-dev



Afterwards, if you are using Create React App you can just add a file that ends in 
.test.js
 and start writing your code, because React Three Test Renderer is testing library agnostic, so it works with libraries such as 
jest
, 
jasmine
 etc.


Let's create an 
App.test.js
 and set up all our test cases:


import
 
ReactThreeTestRenderer
 
from
 
'@react-three/test-renderer'


import
 
{
 
MyRotatingBox
 
}
 
from
 
'./App'




test
(
'mesh to have two children'
,
 
async
 
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 renderer 
=
 
await
 
ReactThreeTestRenderer
.
create
(
<
MyRotatingBox
 
/>
)


}
)




test
(
'click event makes box bigger'
,
 
async
 
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 renderer 
=
 
await
 
ReactThreeTestRenderer
.
create
(
<
MyRotatingBox
 
/>
)


}
)




In here we created three tests and in each we made sure we created the renderer by using the 
create
 function.


Let's start with the first test and make sure our mesh has two children, the material and cube.


We can start by getting the scene and it's children from the test instance we just created like so:


const
 meshChildren 
=
 renderer
.
scene
.
children




If you log this mesh out you can see that it returns an array of one element since that's all we have in the scene.


Using this we can make sure to get that first child and use the 
allChildren
 property on it like so:


const
 meshChildren 
=
 renderer
.
scene
.
children
[
0
]
.
allChildren




There is also one property called 
children
 but this one is meant to be used for things like groups as this one does not return the geometry and the materials, for that we need 
allChildren
.


Now to create our assertion:


expect
(
meshChildren
.
length
)
.
toBe
(
2
)




Our first test case looks like this:


test
(
'mesh to have two children'
,
 
async
 
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 renderer 
=
 
await
 
ReactThreeTestRenderer
.
create
(
<
MyRotatingBox
 
/
>
)


  
const
 mesh 
=
 renderer
.
scene
.
children
[
0
]
.
allChildren


  
expect
(
mesh
.
length
)
.
toBe
(
2
)


}
)




Testing interactions


Now that we have gotten the first test out of the way we can test our interaction and make sure that when we click on the mesh it does indeed update the scale.


We can do that by utilizing the 
fireEvent
 method existing in a test instance.


We know we can get the mesh with:


const
 mesh 
=
 renderer
.
scene
.
children
[
0
]




Since we already have that we can fire an event in it like so:


await
 renderer
.
fireEvent
(
mesh
,
 
'click'
)




With that done, all that's left to do is the tree demonstration of our scene and make sure the scale prop on our mesh has updated:


expect
(
mesh
.
props
.
scale
)
.
toBe
(
1.5
)




In the end our test looks something like this:


test
(
'click event makes box bigger'
,
 
async
 
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 renderer 
=
 
await
 
ReactThreeTestRenderer
.
create
(
<
MyRotatingBox
 
/
>
)


  
const
 mesh 
=
 renderer
.
scene
.
children
[
0
]


  
expect
(
mesh
.
props
.
scale
)
.
toBe
(
1
)


  
await
 renderer
.
fireEvent
(
mesh
,
 
'click'
)


  
expect
(
mesh
.
props
.
scale
)
.
toBe
(
1.5
)


}
)

Installation
Learn how to install react-three-fiber
npm
 
install
 three @react-three/fiber





Fiber is compatible with React v18.0.0+ and works with ReactDOM and React Native.




Getting started with React Three Fiber is not nearly as hard as you might have thought, but various frameworks may require particular attention.


We've put together guides for getting started with each popular framework:




Create React App


Vite.js


Next.js


CDN w/o build tools


React Native




If you just want to give it a try, fork this 
example on codesandbox
!


Create React App


create-react-app
 will work out of the box, nothing special here!


# Create app


npx create-react-app my-app



# Install dependencies


cd
 my-app

npm
 
install
 three @react-three/fiber



# Start development server


npm
 run start



Vite.js


vite
 will also work out of the box.


# Create app


npm
 create vite my-app



# Select react as framework




# Install dependencies


cd
 my-app

npm
 
install
 three @react-three/fiber



# Start development server


npm
 run dev



Next.js


It should work out of the box but you will encounter untranspiled add-ons in the three.js ecosystem, in that case,


Next.js 13.1 or latest version


You need to add three to 
transpilePackages
 property in 
next.config.js
:


transpilePackages
:
 
[
'three'
]
,




Next.js 13.0 or oldest version


You can install the 
next-transpile-modules
 module:


npm
 
install
 next-transpile-modules --save-dev



then, add this to your 
next.config.js


const
 withTM 
=
 
require
(
'next-transpile-modules'
)
(
[
'three'
]
)


module
.
exports
 
=
 
withTM
(
)




Make sure to check out our 
official next.js starter
, too!


Without build tools


You can use React Three Fiber with browser-ready ES Modules from 
esm.sh
 and a JSX-like syntax powered by 
htm
.

ReactDOM
 
from
 
'https://esm.sh/react-dom'

React Native


R3F v8 adds support for react-native and can be imported from 
@react-three/fiber/native
. We use 
expo-gl
 and 
expo-asset
 under the hood for WebGL2 bindings and ensuring interplay between Metro and three.js loaders.


To get started, create an app via 
expo
 or 
react-native
:


# Create a managed/bare app


npx create-expo-app

cd
 my-app



# or




# Create and link bare app


npx react-native init my-app

npx install-expo-modules@latest

cd
 my-app



Then install dependencies (for manual installation or migration, see 
expo modules installation
):


# Automatically install


expo 
install
 expo-gl



# Install NPM dependencies


npm
 
install
 three @react-three/fiber



Some configuration may be required to tell the Metro bundler about your assets if you use 
useLoader
 or Drei abstractions like 
useGLTF
 and 
useTexture
:


// metro.config.js


module
.
exports
 
=
 
{


  
resolver
:
 
{


    
sourceExts
:
 
[
'js'
,
 
'jsx'
,
 
'json'
,
 
'ts'
,
 
'tsx'
,
 
'cjs'
,
 
'mjs'
]
,


    
assetExts
:
 
[
'glb'
,
 
'gltf'
,
 
'png'
,
 
'jpg'
]
,


  
}
,


}




R3F's API is completely x-platform, so you can use 
events
 and 
hooks
 just as you would on the web.


Make sure to import from 
@react-three/fiber/native
 or 
@react-three/drei/native
 for correct IntelliSense and
platform-specific abstractions.


import
 
{
 
Suspense
 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
Canvas
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber/native'


import
 
{
 useGLTF 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei/native'


import
 
modelPath
 
from
 
'./path/to/model.glb'




function
 
Model
(
props
)
 
{


  
const
 gltf 
=
 
useGLTF
(
modelPath
)


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
{
...
props
}
 
object
=
{
gltf
.
scene
}
 
/>


}




export
 
default
 
function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
>


      
<
ambientLight
 
/>


      
<
Suspense
>


        
<
Model
 
/>


      
</
Suspense
>


    
</
Canvas
>


  
)


}

Tips and Tricks


This is a good overview: 
https://discoverthreejs.com/tips-and-tricks


The most important gotcha in three.js is that creating objects can be expensive, think twice before you mount/unmount things! Every material or light that you put into the scene has to compile, every geometry you create will be processed. Share materials and geometries if you can, either in global scope or locally:


const
 geom 
=
 
useMemo
(
(
)
 
=>
 
new
 
BoxGeometry
(
)
,
 
[
]
)


const
 mat 
=
 
useMemo
(
(
)
 
=>
 
new
 
MeshBasicMaterial
(
)
,
 
[
]
)


return
 items
.
map
(
i
 
=>
 
<
mesh geometry
=
{
geom
}
 material
=
{
mat
}
 
...




Try to use 
instancing
 as much as you can when you need to display many objects of a similar type!


Avoid setState in loops


TLDR, don't, mutate inside 
useFrame
!






Threejs has a render-loop, it does not work like the DOM does. 
Fast updates are carried out in 
useFrame
 by mutation
. 
useFrame
 is your per-component render-loop.






It is not enough to set values in succession, 
you need frame deltas
. Instead of 
position.x += 0.1
 consider 
position.x += delta
 or your project will run at different speeds depending on the end-users system. Many updates in threejs need to be paired with update flags (
.needsUpdate = true
), or imperative functions (
.updateProjectionMatrix()
).






You might be tempted to setState inside 
useFrame
 but there is no reason to. You would only complicate something as simple as an update by routing it through Reacts scheduler, triggering component render etc.






‚ùå setState in loops is bad


useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 interval 
=
 
setInterval
(
(
)
 
=>
 
setX
(
(
x
)
 
=>
 x 
+
 
0.1
)
,
 
1
)


  
return
 
(
)
 
=>
 
clearInterval
(
interval
)


}
,
 
[
]
)




‚ùå setState in useFrame is bad


const
 
[
x
,
 setX
]
 
=
 
useState
(
0
)


useFrame
(
(
)
 
=>
 
setX
(
(
x
)
 
=>
 x 
+
 
0.1
)
)


return
 
<
mesh
 
position-x
=
{
x
}
 
/>




‚ùå setState in fast events is bad


<
mesh
 
onPointerMove
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
setX
(
(
x
)
 
=>
 e
.
point
.
x
)
}
 
/>




‚úÖ Instead, just mutate, use deltas


In general you should prefer useFrame. Consider mutating props safe as long as the component is the only entity that mutates. Use deltas instead of fixed values so that your app is refresh-rate independent and runs at the same speed everywhere!


const
 meshRef 
=
 
useRef
(
)


useFrame
(
(
state
,
 delta
)
 
=>
 
(
meshRef
.
current
.
position
.
x
 
+=
 delta
)
)


return
 
<
mesh
 
ref
=
{
meshRef
}
 
/>




Same goes for events, use references.


<
mesh
 
onPointerMove
=
{
(
e
)
 
=>
 
(
ref
.
current
.
position
.
x
 
=
 e
.
point
.
x
)
}
 
/>




If you must use intervals, use references as well, but keep in mind that this is not refresh-rate independent.


useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 interval 
=
 
setInterval
(
(
)
 
=>
 ref
.
current
.
position
.
x
 
+=
 
0.1
,
 
1
)


  
return
 
(
)
 
=>
 
clearInterval
(
interval
)


}
,
 
[
]
)




Handle animations in loops


The frame loop is where you should place your animations. For instance using lerp, or damp.


‚úÖ Use lerp + useFrame


function
 
Signal
(
{
 active 
}
)
 
{


  
const
 meshRef 
=
 
useRef
(
)


  
useFrame
(
(
state
,
 delta
)
 
=>
 
{


    meshRef
.
current
.
position
.
x
 
=
 
THREE
.
MathUtils
.
lerp
(
meshRef
.
current
.
position
.
x
,
 active 
?
 
100
 
:
 
0
,
 
0.1
)


  
}
)


  
return
 
<
mesh
 
ref
=
{
meshRef
}
 
/>




‚úÖ Or react-spring


Or, use animation libraries. React-spring has its own frame-loop and animates outside of React. Framer-motion is another popular alternative.


import
 
{
 a
,
 useSpring 
}
 
from
 
'@react-spring/three'




function
 
Signal
(
{
 active 
}
)
 
{


  
const
 
{
 x 
}
 
=
 
useSpring
(
{
 
x
:
 active 
?
 
100
 
:
 
0
 
}
)


  
return
 
<
a.mesh
 
position-x
=
{
x
}
 
/>




Do not bind to fast state reactively


Using state-managers and selective state is fine, but not for updates that happen rapidly for the same reason as above.


‚ùå Don't bind reactive fast-state


import
 
{
 useSelector 
}
 
from
 
'react-redux'




// Assuming that x gets animated inside the store 60fps


const
 x 
=
 
useSelector
(
(
state
)
 
=>
 state
.
x
)


return
 
<
mesh
 
position-x
=
{
x
}
 
/>




‚úÖ Fetch state directly


For instance using 
Zustand
 (same in Redux et al).


useFrame
(
(
)
 
=>
 
(
ref
.
current
.
position
.
x
 
=
 api
.
getState
(
)
.
x
)
)


return
 
<
mesh
 
ref
=
{
ref
}
 
/>




Don't mount indiscriminately


In threejs it is very common to not re-mount at all, see the 
"disposing of things"
 section in discover-three. This is because buffers and materials get re-initialized/compiled, which can be expensive.


‚ùå Avoid mounting runtime


{


  stage 
===
 
1
 
&&
 
<
Stage1
 
/>


}


{


  stage 
===
 
2
 
&&

‚úÖ Use startTransition for expensive ops


React 18 introduces the 
startTransition
 and 
useTransition
 APIs to defer and schedule work and state updates. Use these to de-prioritize expensive operations.


Since version 8 of Fiber canvases use concurrent mode by default, which means React will schedule and defer expensive operations. You don't need to do anything, but you can play around with the 
experimental scheduler
 and see if marking ops with a lesser priority makes a difference.


import
 
{
 useTransition 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
Points
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'




const
 
[
isPending
,
 startTransition
]
 
=
 
useTransition
(
)


const
 
[
radius
,
 setRadius
]
 
=
 
useState
(
1
)


const
 positions 
=
 
calculatePositions
(
radius
)


const
 colors 
=
 
calculateColors

radius

const

calculateSizes

radius

Don't re-create objects in loops


Try to avoid creating too much effort for the garbage collector, re-pool objects when you can!


‚ùå Bad news for the GC


This creates a new vector 60 times a second, which allocates memory and forces the GC to eventually kick in.


useFrame
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


  ref
.
current
.
position
.
lerp
(
new
 
THREE
.
Vector3
(
x
,
 y
,
 z
)
,
 
0.1
)


}
)




‚úÖ Better re-use object


Set up re-used objects in global or local space, now the GC will be silent.


function
 
Foo
(
props
)


  
const
 vec 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Vector
(
)


  
useFrame
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


    ref
.
current
.
position
.
lerp
(
vec
.
set
(
x
,
 y
,
 z
)
,
 
0.1
)


  
}
)




useLoader instead of plain loaders


Threejs loaders give you the ability to load async assets (models, textures, etc), but if you do not re-use assets it can quickly become problematic.


‚ùå No re-use is bad for perf


This re-fetches, re-parses for every component instance.


function
 
Component
(
)
 
{


  
const
 
[
texture
,
 set
]
 
=
 
useState
(
)


  
useEffect
(
(
)
 
=>
 
void
 
new
 
TextureLoader
(
)
.
load
(
url
,
 set
)
,
 
[
]
)


  
return
 texture 
?
 
(


    
<
mesh
>


      
<
sphereGeometry
 
/>


      
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
map
=
{
texture
}
 
/>


    
</
mesh
>


  
)
 
:
 
null


}




Instead use useLoader, which caches assets and makes them available throughout the scene.


‚úÖ Cache and re-use objects


function
 
Component
(
)
 
{


  
const
 texture 
=
 
useLoader
(
TextureLoader
,
 url
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
mesh
>


      
<
sphereGeometry
 
/>


      
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
map
=
{
texture
}
 
/>


    
</
mesh
>


  
)


}




Regarding GLTF's try to use 
GLTFJSX
 as much as you can, this will create immutable JSX graphs which allow you to even re-use full models.

All the effective ways of using React Three Fiber
Declaring objects


You can use 
three.js's entire object catalogue and all properties
. When in doubt, always consult the docs.


‚ùå You could lay out an object like this:


<
mesh


  
visible


  
userData
=
{
{
 
hello
:
 
'world'
 
}
}


  
position
=
{
new
 
THREE
.
Vector3
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
)
}


  
rotation
=
{
new
 
THREE
.
Euler
(
Math
.
PI
 
/
 
2
,
 
0
,
 
0
)
}


  
geometry
=
{
new
 
THREE
.
SphereGeometry
(
1
,
 
16
,
 
16
)
}


  
material
=
{
new
 
THREE
.
MeshBasicMaterial
(
{
 
color
:
 
new
 
THREE
.
Color
(
'hotpink'
)
,
 
transparent
:
 
true
 
}
)
}


/>




‚úÖ The problem is that all of these properties will always be re-created. Instead, you should define properties declaratively.


<
mesh
 
visible
 
userData
=
{
{
 
hello
:
 
'world'
 
}
}
 
position
=
{
[
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
]
}
 
rotation
=
{
[
Math
.
PI
 
/
 
2
,
 
0
,
 
0
]
}
>


  
<
sphereGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
1
,
 
16
,
 
16
]
}
 
/>


  
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
color
=
"
hotpink
"
 
transparent
 
/>


</
mesh
>




Constructor arguments


In three.js objects are classes that are instantiated. These classes can receive one-time constructor arguments (
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32)
), and properties (
someObject.visible = true
). In React Three Fiber, constructor arguments are always passed as an array via 
args
. If args change later on, the object must naturally get reconstructed from scratch!


<
sphereGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
1
,
 
32
]
}
 
/>




Shortcuts


Set


All properties whose underlying object has a 
.set()
 method can directly receive the same arguments that 
set
 would otherwise take. For example 
THREE.Color.set
 can take a color string, so instead of 
color={new THREE.Color('hotpink')}
 you can simply write 
color="hotpink"
. Some 
set
 methods take multiple arguments, for instance 
THREE.Vector3
, give it an array in that case 
position={[100, 0, 0]}
.


<
mesh
 
position
=
{
[
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
]
}
 
/>


  
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
color
=
"
hotpink
"
 
/>




If you do link up an existing object to a property, for instance a THREE.Vector3() to a position, be aware that this
will end up copying the object in most cases as it calls .copy() on the target. This only applies to objects that
expose both .set() and .copy() (Vectors, Eulers, Matrix, ...). If you link up an existing material or geometry on the
other hand, it will overwrite, because more these objects do not have a .set() method.


SetScalar


Properties that have a 
setScalar
 method (for instance 
Vector3
) can be set like so:


// Translates to <mesh scale={[1, 1, 1]} />


<
mesh
 
scale
=
{
1
}
 
/>




Piercing into nested properties


If you want to reach into nested attributes (for instance: 
mesh.rotation.x
), just use dash-case.


<
mesh
 
rotation-x
=
{
1
}
 
material-uniforms-resolution-value
=
{
[
512
,
 
512
]
}
 
/>




Dealing with non-scene objects


You can put non-Object3D primitives (geometries, materials, etc) into the render tree as well. They take the same properties and constructor arguments they normally would.


You might be wondering why you would want to put something in the "scene" that normally would not be part of it, in a vanilla three.js app at least. For the same reason you declare any object: it becomes managed, reactive and auto-disposes. These objects are not technically part of the scene, but they "attach" to a parent which is.


Attach


Use 
attach
 to bind objects to their parent. If you unmount the attached object it will be taken off its parent automatically.


The following attaches a material to the 
material
 property of a mesh and a geometry to the 
geometry
 property:


<
mesh
>


  
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
attach
=
"
material
"
 
/>


  
<
boxGeometry
 
attach
=
"
geometry
"
 
/>




All objects extending 
THREE.Material
 receive 
attach="material"
, and all objects extending 
THREE.BufferGeometry
 receive

attach="geometry"
. You do not have to type it out!


<
mesh
>


  
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
/>


  
<
boxGeometry
 
/>




You can also deeply nest attach through piercing. The following adds a buffer-attribute to 
geometry.attributes.position
 and then adds the buffer geometry to 
mesh.geometry
.


<
mesh
>


  
<
bufferGeometry
>


    
<
bufferAttribute
 
attach
=
"
attributes-position
"
 
count
=
{
v
.
length
 
/
 
3
}
 
array
=
{
v
}
 
itemSize
=
{
3
}
 
/>




More examples


// Attach bar to foo.a


<
foo
>


  
<
bar
 
attach
=
"
a
"
 
/>




// Attach bar to foo.a.b and foo.a.b.c (nested object attach)

<
foo
>


  
<
bar
 
attach
=
"
a-b
"
 
/>


  
<
bar
 
attach
=
"
a-b-c
"
 
/>




// Attach bar to foo.a[0] and foo.a[1] (array attach is just object attach)

<
foo
>


  
<
bar
 
attach
=
"
a-0
"
 
/>


  
<
bar
 
attach
=
"
a-1
"
 
/>




// Attach bar to foo via explicit add/remove functions

<
foo
>


  
<
bar
 
attach
=
{
(
parent
,
 self
)
 
=>
 
{


    parent
.
add
(
self
)


    
return
 
(
)
 
=>
 parent
.
remove
(
self
)


  
}
}
 
/>




// The same as a one liner

<
foo
>


  
<
bar
 
attach
=
{
(
parent
,
 self
)
 
=>
 
(
parent
.
add
(
self
)
,
 
(
)
 
=>
 parent
.
remove
(
self
)
)
}
 
/>




Real-world use-cases:


Attaching to nested objects, for instance a shadow-camera:


-
 <directionalLight

-
   castShadow

-
   position={[2.5, 8, 5]}

-
   shadow-mapSize={[1024, 1024]}

-
   shadow-camera-far={50}

-
   shadow-camera-left={-10}

-
   shadow-camera-right={10}

-
   shadow-camera-top={10}

-
   shadow-camera-bottom={-10}

-
 />

+
 <directionalLight castShadow position={[2.5, 8, 5]} shadow-mapSize={[1024, 1024]}>

+
   <orthographicCamera attach="shadow-camera" args={[-10, 10, 10, -10]} />

+
 </directionalLight>



Arrays must have explicit order, for instance multi-materials:


<
mesh
>


  
{
colors
.
map
(
(
color
,
 index
)
 
=>
 
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
key
=
{
index
}
 
attach
=
{
`
material-
${
index
}
`
}
 
color
=
{
color
}
 
/>
}


</
mesh
>




Putting already existing objects into the scene-graph


You can use the 
primitive
 placeholder for that. You can still give it properties or attach nodes to it. Never add the same object multiple times, this is not allowed in three.js! Primitives will not dispose of the object they carry on unmount, you are responsible for disposing of it!


const
 mesh 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
Mesh
(
geometry
,
 material
)




function
 
Component
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
object
=
{
mesh
}
 
position
=
{
[
10
,
 
0
,
 
0
]
}
 
/>




Using 3rd-party objects declaratively


The 
extend
 function extends React Three Fiber's catalogue of JSX elements. Components added this way can then be referenced in the scene-graph using camel casing similar to other primitives.


import
 
{
 extend 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
OrbitControls
,
 
TransformControls
 
}
 
from
 
'three-stdlib'


extend
(
{
 
OrbitControls
,
 
TransformControls
 
}
)




// ...


return
 
(


  
<
>


    
<
orbitControls
 
/>


    
<
transformControls
 
/>




If you're using TypeScript, you'll also need to 
extend the JSX namespace
.


Disposal


Freeing resources is a 
manual chore in 
three.js
, but React is aware of object-lifecycles, hence React Three Fiber will attempt to free resources for you by calling 
object.dispose()
, if present, on all unmounted objects.


If you manage assets by yourself, globally or in a cache, this may 
not
 be what you want. You can switch it off by placing 
dispose={null}
 onto meshes, materials, etc, or even on parent containers like groups, it is now valid for the entire tree.


const
 globalGeometry 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
BoxGeometry
(
)


const
 globalMaterial 
=
 
new
 
THREE
.
MeshBasicMaterial
(
)




function
 
Mesh
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
group
 
dispose
=
{
null
}
>


      
<
mesh
 
geometry
=
{
globalGeometry
}
 
material
=
{
globalMaterial
}
 
/>

Loading Models
3D Software to the web!


All the models in this page were created by Sara Vieira and are freely available to download from any of the sandboxes.




There are many types of 3D model extensions, in this page we will focus on loading the three most common ones: 
GLTF
, 
FBX
 and 
OBJ
. All of these will use the 
useLoader
 function but in slightly different ways.


This whole section will assume you have placed your models in the public folder or in a place in your application where you can import them easily.


Loading GLTF models


Starting with the open standard and the one that has more support in React Three Fiber we will load a 
.gltf
 model.


Let's start by importing the two things we need:


import
 
{
 useLoader 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
GLTFLoader
 
}
 
from
 
'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'




With this we can create a Model component and place it in our scene like so:


function
 
Scene
(
)
 
{


  
const
 gltf 
=
 
useLoader
(
GLTFLoader
,
 
'/Poimandres.gltf'
)


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
object
=
{
gltf
.
scene
}
 
/>


}




You can play with the sandbox and see how it looks here after I added an HDRI background:


GLTFLoader


Loading GLTF models as JSX Components


Here comes the really fancy part, you can transform these models into React components and then use them as you would any React component.


To do this, grab your 
GLTF
 model and head over to 
https://gltf.pmnd.rs/
 and drop your 
GLTF
, after that you should see something like:




Let's now copy the code and move it over to 
Model.js
:


/*

Auto-generated by: https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx

*/




import
 
React
,
 
{
 useRef 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 useGLTF 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'




export
 
default
 
function
 
Model
(
props
)
 
{


  
const
 groupRef 
=
 
useRef
(
)


  
const
 
{
 nodes
,
 materials 
}
 
=
 
useGLTF
(
'/Poimandres.gltf'
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
group
 
ref
=
{
groupRef
}
 
{
...
props
}
 
dispose
=
{
null
}
>


      
<
mesh
 
castShadow
 
receiveShadow
 
geometry
=
{
nodes
.
Curve007_1
.
geometry
}
 
material
=
{
materials
[
'Material.001'
]
}
 
/>


      
<
mesh
 
castShadow
 
receiveShadow
 
geometry
=
{
nodes
.
Curve007_2
.
geometry
}
 
material
=
{
materials
[
'Material.002'
]
}
 
/>


    
</
group
>


  
)


}




useGLTF
.
preload
(
'/Poimandres.gltf'
)




Now we can import our model like we would import any React component and use it in our app:


import
 
{
 
Suspense
 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
Canvas
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
Environment
 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'




import
 
Model
 
from
 
'./Model'




export
 
default
 
function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
div
 
className
=
"
App
"
>


      
<
Canvas
>


        
<
Suspense
 
fallback
=
{
null
}
>


          
<
Model
 
/>


          
<
Environment
 
preset
=
"
sunset
"
 
background
 
/>


        
</
Suspense
>


      
</
Canvas
>


    
</
div
>


  
)


}




You can play with the sandbox here:


gltfjsx


Loading OBJ models


In this case, we will use the trusted 
useLoader
 hook but in combination with 
three.js
 
OBJLoader
.


import
 
{
 
OBJLoader
 
}
 
from
 
'three/examples/jsm/loaders/OBJLoader'


import
 
{
 useLoader 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




With these imported let's get the mesh into our scene:


function
 
Scene
(
)
 
{


  
const
 obj 
=
 
useLoader
(
OBJLoader
,
 
'/Poimandres.obj'
)


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
object
=
{
obj
}
 
/>


}




And here we go, we have an OBJ model showing on the web! Pretty cool ah?


You can play with the sandbox here:


OBJLoader


Loading FBX models


Let's again use the trusted 
useLoader
 but this time with the 
FBXLoader
 that comes from 
three.js


import
 
{
 useLoader 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
FBXLoader
 
}
 
from
 
'three/examples/jsm/loaders/FBXLoader'




To create our scene we can get the FBX as a return value of the useLoader by passing the 
FBXloader
 and the location of our file like so:


function
 
Scene
(
)
 
{


  
const
 fbx 
=
 
useLoader
(
FBXLoader
,
 
'/Poimandres.fbx'
)


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
object
=
{
fbx
}
 
/>


}




You can play with the sandbox here:


FBXLoader


Loading FBX models using useFBX


@react-three/drei
 exports a very useful helper when it comes to loading FBX models and it's called 
useFBX
, in this case there is no need to import anything from 
three.js
 as it is all done behind the scenes and we can just pass the location of the file to 
useFBX
 like so:


function
 
Scene
(
)
 
{


  
const
 fbx 
=
 
useFBX
(
'/Poimandres.fbx'
)


  
return
 
<
primitive
 
object
=
{
fbx
}
 
/>


}




You can play with the sandbox here:

If your model is big and takes a while to load, it's always good to show a small loader of how much is already is loaded and again 
@react-three/drei
 is here to help with 
Html
 and 
useProgress
.




Html
 allows you place plain ol' HTML in your canvas and render it like you would a normal DOM element.


useProgress
 is a hook that gives you a bunch of information about the loading status of your model.




With these two things, we can create a very bare-bones loading component like so:


import
 
{
 
Html
,
 useProgress 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/drei'




function
 
Loader
(
)
 
{


  
const
 
{
 progress 
}
 
=
 
useProgress
(
)


  
return
 
<
Html
 
center
>
{
progress
}
 % loaded
</
Html
>


}




We can then wrap our model in it using 
Suspense
 like so:


export
 
default
 
function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
>


      
<
Suspense
 
fallback
=
{
<
Loader
 
/>
}
>


        
<
Model
 
/>


      
</
Suspense
>


    
</
Canvas
>


  
)


}




The hook returns much more than just the progress so there is a lot you can do there to give the user more information about the loading status of the application. You can play with all of them in this sandbox:

Basic Animations
This guide will help you understand refs, useFrame and how to make basic animations with Fiber
This tutorial will assume some React knowledge, and will be based on 
this starter codesandbox
, so just fork it and follow along!


We will build a really small, continuous animation loop, that will be the basic building block of more advanced animations later on.


useFrame


useFrame
 is a Fiber hook that lets you execute code on every frame of Fiber's render loop. This can have a lot of uses, but we will focus on building an animation with it.


It's important to remember that 
Fiber hooks can only be called inside a 
<Canvas />
 parent
!


import
 
{
 useFrame 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'




function
 
MyAnimatedBox
(
)
 
{


  
useFrame
(
(
)
 
=>
 
{


    
console
.
log
(
"Hey, I'm executing every frame!"
)


  
}
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
mesh
>


      
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


      
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
color
=
"
royalblue
"
 
/>


    
</
mesh
>


  
)


}




This loop is the basic building block of our animation, the callback we pass to 
useFrame
 will be executed every frame and it will be passed an object containing the state of our Fiber scene:


For example, we can extract time information from the 
clock
 parameter, to know how much time has elapsed in our application, and use that time to animate a value:


useFrame
(
(
{
 clock 
}
)
 
=>
 
{


  
const
 a 
=
 clock
.
getElapsedTime
(
)


  
console
.
log
(
a
)
 
// the value will be 0 at scene initialization and grow each frame


}
)




clock
 is a 
three.js Clock
 object, from which we are getting the total elapsed time, which will be key for our animations.


Animating with Refs


It would be tempting to just update the state of our component via 
setState
 and let it change the 
mesh
 via props, but going through state isn't ideal, when dealing with continuous updates, commonly know as 
transient updates
.
Instead, we want to 
directly mutate our mesh each frame
. First, we'll have to get a 
reference
 to it, via the 
useRef
 React hook:


import
 
React
 
from
 
'react'




function
 
MyAnimatedBox
(
)
 
{


  
const
 myMesh 
=
 
React
.
useRef
(
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
mesh
 
ref
=
{
myMesh
}
>


      
<
boxGeometry
 
/>


      
<
meshBasicMaterial
 
color
=
"
royalblue
"
 
/>


    
</
mesh
>


  
)


}




myMesh
 will now hold a reference to the actual three.js object, which we can now freely mutate in 
useFrame
, without having to worry about React:


useFrame
(
(
{
 clock 
}
)
 
=>
 
{


  myMesh
.
current
.
rotation
.
x
 
=
 clock
.
getElapsedTime
(
)


}
)




Let's have a closer look:




We are destructuring 
clock
 from the argument passed to 
useFrame
, which we know is the state of our Fiber scene.


We are accessing the 
rotation.x
 property of 
myMesh.current
 object, which is a reference to our mesh object


We are assigning our time-dependent value 
a
 to the 
rotation
 on the 
x
 axis, meaning our object will now infinitely rotate between -1 and 1 radians around the x axis!

Exercises




Try 
Math.sin(clock.getElapsedTime())
 and see how your animation changes

How does it work?
Introduction
React-three-fiber is a React renderer for three.js.




Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can participate in React's ecosystem.


npm
 
install
 three @types/three @react-three/fiber



Does it have limitations?


None. Everything that works in Threejs will work here without exception.


Is it slower than plain Threejs?


No. There is no overhead. Components render outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to Reacts scheduling abilities.


Can it keep up with frequent feature updates to Threejs?


Yes. It merely expresses Threejs in JSX, 
<mesh />
 dynamically turns into 
new THREE.Mesh()
. If a new Threejs version adds, removes or changes features, it will be available to you instantly without depending on updates to this library.


What does it look like?


Let's make a re-usable component that has its own state, reacts to user-input and participates in the
render-loop. (

First steps


You need to be versed in both React and Threejs before rushing into this. If you are unsure about React consult the official 
React docs
, especially 
the section about hooks
. As for Threejs, make sure you at least glance over the following links:




Make sure you have a 
basic grasp of Threejs
. Keep that site open.


When you know what a scene is, a camera, mesh, geometry, material, fork the 
demo above
.


Look up
 the JSX elements that you see (mesh, ambientLight, etc), 
all
 threejs exports are native to three-fiber.


Try changing some values, scroll through our 
API
 to see what the various settings and hooks do.

Loading Textures
Let's load some fancy textures.


All textures used in this chapter were downloaded from 
cc0textures
.




Using TextureLoader & useLoader


To load the textures we will use the 
TextureLoader
 from three.js in combination with 
useLoader
 that will allow us to pass the location of the texture and get the map back.


It's better to explain with code, let's say you downloaded 
this texture
 and placed it in the public folder of your site, to get the color map from it you could do:


const
 colorMap 
=
 
useLoader
(
TextureLoader
,
 
'PavingStones092_1K_Color.jpg'
)




Let's then with this information create a small scene where we can use this texture:


import
 
{
 
Suspense
 
}
 
from
 
'react'


import
 
{
 
Canvas
,
 useLoader 
}
 
from
 
'@react-three/fiber'


import
 
{
 
TextureLoader
 
}
 
from
 
'three/src/loaders/TextureLoader'




function
 
Scene
(
)
 
{


  
const
 colorMap 
=
 
useLoader
(
TextureLoader
,
 
'PavingStones092_1K_Color.jpg'
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
>


      
<
ambientLight
 
intensity
=
{
0.2
}
 
/>


      
<
directionalLight
 
/>


      
<
mesh
>


        
<
sphereGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
1
,
 
32
,
 
32
]
}
 
/>


        
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
/>


      
</
mesh
>


    
</
>


  
)


}




export
 
default
 
function
 
App
(
)
 
{


  
return
 
(


    
<
Canvas
>


      
<
Suspense
 
fallback
=
{
null
}
>


        
<
Scene
 
/>


      
</
Suspense
>


    
</
Canvas
>


  
)


}




If everything went according to plan, you should now be able to apply this texture to the sphere like so:


<
meshStandardMaterial
 
map
=
{
colorMap
}
 
/>




Awesome! That works but we have a lot more textures to import and do we have to create a different useLoader for each of them?


That's the great part! You don't, the second argument is an array where you can pass all the textures you have and the maps will be returned and ready to use:


const
 
[
colorMap
,
 displacementMap
,
 normalMap
,
 roughnessMap
,
 aoMap
]
 
=
 
useLoader
(
TextureLoader
,
 
[


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Color.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Displacement.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Normal.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Roughness.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_AmbientOcclusion.jpg'
,


]
)




Now we can place them in our mesh like so:


<
meshStandardMaterial


  
map
=
{
colorMap
}


  
displacementMap
=
{
displacementMap
}


  
normalMap
=
{
normalMap
}


  
roughnessMap
=
{
roughnessMap
}


  
aoMap
=
{
aoMap
}


/>




The displacement will probably be too much, usually setting it to 0.2 will make it look good. Our final code would look something like:


function
 
Scene
(
)
 
{


  
const
 
[
colorMap
,
 displacementMap
,
 normalMap
,
 roughnessMap
,
 aoMap
]
 
=
 
useLoader
(
TextureLoader
,
 
[


    
'PavingStones092_1K_Color.jpg'
,


    
'PavingStones092_1K_Displacement.jpg'
,


    
'PavingStones092_1K_Normal.jpg'
,


    
'PavingStones092_1K_Roughness.jpg'
,


    
'PavingStones092_1K_AmbientOcclusion.jpg'
,


  
]
)


  
return
 
(


    
<
mesh
>


      
{
/* Width and height segments for displacementMap */
}


      
<
sphereGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
1
,
 
100
,
 
100
]
}
 
/>


      
<
meshStandardMaterial


        
displacementScale
=
{
0.2
}


        
map
=
{
colorMap
}


        
displacementMap
=
{
displacementMap
}


        
normalMap
=
{
normalMap
}


        
roughnessMap
=
{
roughnessMap
}


        
aoMap
=
{
aoMap
}


      
/>


    
</
mesh
>


  
)


}




Using useTexture


Another way to import these is using 
useTexture
 from 
@react-three/drei
, that will make it slightly easier and there is no need to import the 
TextureLoader
, our code would look like:


import
 
{
 useTexture 
}
 
from
 
"@react-three/drei"




...




const
 
[
colorMap
,
 displacementMap
,
 normalMap
,
 roughnessMap
,
 aoMap
]
 
=
 
useTexture
(
[


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Color.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Displacement.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Normal.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_Roughness.jpg'
,


  
'PavingStones092_1K_AmbientOcclusion.jpg'
,


]
)




You can also use object-notation which is the most convenient:


const
 props 
=
 
useTexture
(
{


  
map
:
 
'PavingStones092_1K_Color.jpg'
,


  
displacementMap
:
 
'PavingStones092_1K_Displacement.jpg'
,


  
normalMap
:
 
'PavingStones092_1K_Normal.jpg'
,


  
roughnessMap
:
 
'PavingStones092_1K_Roughness.jpg'
,


  
aoMap
:
 
'PavingStones092_1K_AmbientOcclusion.jpg'
,


}
)




return
 
(


  
<
mesh
>


    
<
sphereGeometry
 
args
=
{
[
1
,
 
32
,
 
32
]
}
 
/>


    
<
meshStandardMaterial
 
{
...
props
}
 
/>


  
</
mesh
>


)
